##Rest Sharp

	The main purpose of RestSharp is to make synchronous and asynchronous calls to remote resources over HTTP. 
	As the name suggests, the main audience of RestSharp are developers who use REST APIs.

	One of the main challenges of using HTTP APIs for .NET developers is 
	to work with requests and responses of different kinds and translate them to complex C# types. 

	RestSharp can take care of 
	serializing the request body to JSON or XML and 
	deserialize the response.

	It can also form a valid request URI based on different parameter kinds 
	path, query, form or body.
